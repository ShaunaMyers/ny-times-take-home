# NY Times Take Home Assignment

## Overview
 The goal of this task was to simulate a take home challenge that one might receive during the interview process. The application took a NY Times api and displayed articles, gave user the ability to search articles, and the ability to view a specific article in a detailed view. Basic application was completed in 8 hours with an extension of 4 hours for added features. Time managment and planning were prioritized, as well as explaining the process and reasoning behind decisions.
